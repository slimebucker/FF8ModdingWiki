# __Creating Junction 8 Angelwing mod to work in junction 8__


## __Download__
  - **Download Angelwing Ultima. Version 1.0a , 1.1 and 2.0 all work. Old NON ULTIMA version do not work.**

  - This is a paid mod, you either have to get it from [Mcindus Mods Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/cw/mcindusmods)
  - or ask around on either GOOGLE, or the discords

## __Extract__
   - **Extract Angelwing download file with either 7zip or winzip "extract to */"**
   - If using Angelwing Ultima 1.1 also download and extract the TOMB UPDATE. Copy the files from the TOMB UPDATE over to the Angelwings Ultima folder and replace files.

## __Cut Textures__
   - Go inside the Angelwing Ultima folder that was extracted. Go inside the textures Folder. Then go inside the field_bg folder. 
   - **Cut all 2 letter folders. (right click, select all, then right click and CUT, or CONTROL+A, then CONTROL+X)**

## __Locate JUNCTION 8 Library Folder__
   - **Locate JUNCTION 8 mod directory. If on C drive, default directory will be C:\Users\USERNAME\Junction VIII**

   - If it is not installed in default location and you are unsure where it is, you can find the directory in Junction8.
   - open up junction 8, go SETTINGS, GENERAL SETTINGS
      At the top is PATHS. FF8 EXE - shows the game directory and library shows the JUNCTION 8 mod directory. Library is the directory we want.

## __Create Directory__
   - Go to Junction 8 mod Directory, and make a folder called ANGELWING
   - inside this folder create a folder called mods
   - inside mods folder create a folder named textures
   - inside textures folder create a folder named field
   - inside field folder create mapdata folder

  ** The directory you are now in should look like this Junction VIII\mods\textures\field\mapdata\**

## __Paste__
   - **Inside Junction VIII\mods\textures\field\mapdata\ paste all the 2 letter folders from ANGELWING ULTIMA.**
   - right click PASTE, or CONTROL+V

## __Activate__
    - Open up Junction 8. There will be a new mod on your mod list called ANGELWING (or what ever you named the folder in the JUNCTION VIII directory)
    - **Make sure this mod is set to ON.**

    - If or when Mcindus creates a new offical version, just turn this mod off, or delete it.
